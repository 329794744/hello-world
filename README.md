# hello-world

Hi world,

This is Siyi here. It is my first day in Github and found here so cool. 

I'm typying at a Costa near my living place. Here is like my little corner where I can work on my own stuffs, though not that much quiet. 

I have been planning to learn coding for a while but keep procrastonating. Finally I'm here, starting from zero. I believe my logical capability and persistance will walk me through the whole process, and I will turn out to be a good coder. 

I know many others out here are like me, knowing nothing about coding stuff but are eager to learn. Hang in there, we will see the results.
